Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Aditya Dahiya, an IAS *(Indian Administrative Service)* officer navigating the intricate labyrinth of the Indian Administrative Service in the Government of Haryana. While my day job might involve more paperwork than I care to admit, my true passion lies in the world of health data visualization.

My journey began with a stethoscope around my neck and a medical degree from the AIIMS, New Delhi, earned from 2005 to 2010. But in 2011, I decided to swap the scrubs for a suit and tie and jumped headfirst into the world of civil service. Fast forward to 2021-22, and I found myself on the hallowed grounds of Harvard University, where I earned an MPH degree, because why not?

Now, you might wonder how someone with a day job in bureaucracy and a penchant for health data visualization ended up creating solutions for the first edition of "An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R." Well, my secret lies in seizing those precious moments of free time. And during one such moment, I embarked on a journey of statistical enlightenment by enrolling in Johns Hopkins University's 140.644.01 - Statistical Machine Learning course.

The result? A treasure trove of solutions that I'm delighted to share with you. Whether you're a fellow learner, an aspiring statistician, or just a curious soul, this website is your go-to resource for unraveling the mysteries of statistical learning, sprinkled with a dash of wit and a pinch of my unique perspective.

So, join me on this data-driven adventure at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-aditya-dahiya-ias/) or shoot me an [email](mailto:%20adityadahiyaaiims@proton.me). Even bureaucrats can have a little statistical swagger!
