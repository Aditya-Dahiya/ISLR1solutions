However, comparatively, a non-flexible method will perform better as it is less likely to overfit or mis-read noise for actual relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scenario is a regression problem, because the response / outcome is a continuous variable, i.e. CEO Salary.\n\nHere, we are primarily interested in inference, rather than prediction, because we want to understand which factors affect CEO salary, rather than predicting the salary for any given CEO.\n\nIn this scenario, \\(n = 500\\) and \\(p = 3\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scenario is a classification problem, as the primary response is a qualitative variable (success vs. failure).\n\nHere, we are primarily interested in prediction because we wish to know the response our test data, i.e. new product being launched, rather than understanding the factors behind the response.\n\nIn this scenario, \\(n = 20\\) and \\(p = 13\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scenario is a regression problem, because the response / outcome is a continuous variable, i.e. percentage change in US dollar.\n\nHere, we are primarily interested in prediction instead of inference since our intended purpose to predict % change in US dollar. We are not concerned with the exact factors that cause such a change.\n\nIn this scenario, \\(n = 52\\) (i.e. number of weeks in 2012) and \\(p = 3\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sketch is displayed below: —\n \n\n\n\nIn this figure, the curve (C) is the Irreducible Error which is a feature of the data-set, and thus stays constant. The curve(D) represents the Training Error which will always decrease monotonously with increasing flexibility of the fitted model because almost all techniques directly or indirectly aim at reducing the MSE in the training data-set. As flexibility of the method increases, it’s variance will increase [curve (B)] and bias will decrease [curve(D)] because a flexible model is highly variable (change in a single observation will change the fit) and less biased (each observation is closely covered). The sum of curves B, C and E represents the Test Error i.e. Curve A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree real-life applications in which classification is useful are: —\nEmail Spam\n1. Response: A qualitative binary indicator whether the email is spam or not spam.\n2. Predictors: Presence of common words in subject of the email (such as offer, lottery etc.), Presence of name of email account holder in text of email, Unverified attachments, Relative frequency of commonly used words.\n3. Goal of the application: Prediction.\n\nHandwriting recognition : ZIP codes on postal envelopes\n1. Response: Each of the 5 digits (0-9) - categorical outcome\n2. Predictors: A matrix corresponding to an image where each pixel corresponds is an entry in the matrix, and its pixel intensity ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white).\n3. Goal of the application: Prediction\n\nFactors Affecting Consumer purchase amongst competing goods : Which factors most affect the consumers’ purchase of a particular product amongst competing brands.\n1. Response: Which one of the competing products does a consumer buy?\n2. Predictors: Area, demographics of buyer, advertising revenues etc.\n3. Goal of the application: Inference.\n\n\n\nThree real-life applications in which regression is useful are: —\n1. Predicting response to dosage of BP medication\ni) Response: Blood Pressure (in mmHg)\nii) Predictors: Dose of a given medication, age, vital indicators etc.\niii) Goal of the application: Prediction\n\n2. Factors affecting Crop Yields\ni) Response: Crop Yield in units per area\nii) Predictors: Amount of fertilizer applied, Soil pH, Temperature, Machines used, etc.\niii) Goal of the application: Both inference (which inputs yield maximum benefits) and prediction (expected crop yield in a particular season)\n\n3. Increasing operational efficiency in a production line by identifying low-hanging fruits\ni) Response: Factory output of a good\nii) Predictors: Various raw materials, number of workers, capital investment, working hours, etc.\niii) Goal of the application: Inference (spending on which input / predictor) will cause maximum increase in output.\n\n\n\nThree real-life applications in which cluster analysis is useful are: —\n1. Social Network Clusters: Identifying like-minded twitter users based on their activity.\n2. Finding Similar books for a book recommendation software based on past purchase data from users.\n3. Gene mapping in evolutionary biology to find clusters of similar genes within a genome / evolutionary lineage.\n\n\n\n\n\nA very flexible approach has following advantages and disadvantages :–\n\n\n\nAdvantages: Allows fitting to highly non-linear relationships. Better performance when \\(n\\) is large and \\(p\\) is small.\nDisadvantages: Requires estimation of a large number of parameters. Low level of interpretability. Can lead to overfitting. Does not perform well when \\(n\\) is very small or data is high-dimensional i.e. large \\(p\\).\n\n\nA more flexible approach may be considered when we have a large data (high \\(n\\)), low dimensionality (low \\(p\\)), or when we are mainly interested in prediction in a non-linear relationship.\nA less flexible approach is preferred when out objective is inference and interpretability of the results. (Or when data is high dimensional or low \\(n\\).)\n\n\n\n\nA parametric statistical learning approach assumes a \\(f(x)\\) i.e. it pre-supposes a functional form for relationship between predictors and response. On the other hand, a non-parametric approach does not assume any functional form for \\(f\\) at all. It just tries to best fit the available data. Thus, it requires a very large amount of data.\n\nParametric approach advantages:\n1) Easier to compute and evaluate\n2) Interpretation is simpler\n3) Better for inference tasks.\n4) Can be used with a low number of observations.\n\nParametric approach disadvantages:\n1) If the underlying relationship is far off from assumed functional form, the method will lead to high error rate.\n2) If too flexible a model fitted, it will lead to overfitting.\n3) Real-life relations are rarely simple functional forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"docs/ISLRCh2Ex2-4Q7.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(y = as.factor(y)) |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_000 = sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2))\ndata |&gt; kbl() |&gt; kable_classic_2(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nx1\nx2\nx3\ny\ndist_000\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n0\nred\n3.000000\n\n\n2\n0\n0\nred\n2.000000\n\n\n0\n1\n3\nred\n3.162278\n\n\n0\n1\n2\ngreen\n2.236068\n\n\n-1\n0\n1\ngreen\n1.414214\n\n\n1\n1\n1\nred\n1.732051\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distance between each test point and the test point (0,0,0) is displayed above, and for the six points is\n3.00 2.00 3.16 2.24 1.41 1.73\n\n\n\nWith \\(K=1\\), our prediction for \\(y\\) is “green”, as the nearest neighbor is “green”.\n\n\n\nWith \\(K=3\\), our prediction for \\(y\\) is “red”, as the nearest neighbors are 1 “green” and 2 “red”.\n\n\n\nIf the Bayes Decision Boundary is highly non-linear, then we would expect the best value of \\(K\\) to be small, because a smaller \\(K\\) allows us more flexibility in the estimated decision boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata(College)\ncollege &lt;- College\nrm(College)\n\n\n\n\n\nrownames(college) &lt;- college[,1]\nfix(college)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Private        Apps           Accept          Enroll       Top10perc    \n No :212   Min.   :   81   Min.   :   72   Min.   :  35   Min.   : 1.00  \n Yes:565   1st Qu.:  776   1st Qu.:  604   1st Qu.: 242   1st Qu.:15.00  \n           Median : 1558   Median : 1110   Median : 434   Median :23.00  \n           Mean   : 3002   Mean   : 2019   Mean   : 780   Mean   :27.56  \n           3rd Qu.: 3624   3rd Qu.: 2424   3rd Qu.: 902   3rd Qu.:35.00  \n           Max.   :48094   Max.   :26330   Max.   :6392   Max.   :96.00  \n   Top25perc      F.Undergrad     P.Undergrad         Outstate    \n Min.   :  9.0   Min.   :  139   Min.   :    1.0   Min.   : 2340  \n 1st Qu.: 41.0   1st Qu.:  992   1st Qu.:   95.0   1st Qu.: 7320  \n Median : 54.0   Median : 1707   Median :  353.0   Median : 9990  \n Mean   : 55.8   Mean   : 3700   Mean   :  855.3   Mean   :10441  \n 3rd Qu.: 69.0   3rd Qu.: 4005   3rd Qu.:  967.0   3rd Qu.:12925  \n Max.   :100.0   Max.   :31643   Max.   :21836.0   Max.   :21700  \n   Room.Board       Books           Personal         PhD        \n Min.   :1780   Min.   :  96.0   Min.   : 250   Min.   :  8.00  \n 1st Qu.:3597   1st Qu.: 470.0   1st Qu.: 850   1st Qu.: 62.00  \n Median :4200   Median : 500.0   Median :1200   Median : 75.00  \n Mean   :4358   Mean   : 549.4   Mean   :1341   Mean   : 72.66  \n 3rd Qu.:5050   3rd Qu.: 600.0   3rd Qu.:1700   3rd Qu.: 85.00  \n Max.   :8124   Max.   :2340.0   Max.   :6800   Max.   :103.00  \n    Terminal       S.F.Ratio      perc.alumni        Expend     \n Min.   : 24.0   Min.   : 2.50   Min.   : 0.00   Min.   : 3186  \n 1st Qu.: 71.0   1st Qu.:11.50   1st Qu.:13.00   1st Qu.: 6751  \n Median : 82.0   Median :13.60   Median :21.00   Median : 8377  \n Mean   : 79.7   Mean   :14.09   Mean   :22.74   Mean   : 9660  \n 3rd Qu.: 92.0   3rd Qu.:16.50   3rd Qu.:31.00   3rd Qu.:10830  \n Max.   :100.0   Max.   :39.80   Max.   :64.00   Max.   :56233  \n   Grad.Rate     \n Min.   : 10.00  \n 1st Qu.: 53.00  \n Median : 65.00  \n Mean   : 65.46  \n 3rd Qu.: 78.00  \n Max.   :118.00  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs per the summary() function, there are 78 elite universities.

We are not concerned with the exact factors that cause such a change.\n\nIn this scenario, \\(n = 52\\) (i.e. number of weeks in 2012) and \\(p = 3\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sketch is displayed below: —\n \n\n\n\nIn this figure, the curve (C) is the Irreducible Error which is a feature of the data-set, and thus stays constant. The curve(D) represents the Training Error which will always decrease monotonously with increasing flexibility of the fitted model because almost all techniques directly or indirectly aim at reducing the MSE in the training data-set. As flexibility of the method increases, it’s variance will increase [curve (B)] and bias will decrease [curve(D)] because a flexible model is highly variable (change in a single observation will change the fit) and less biased (each observation is closely covered). The sum of curves B, C and E represents the Test Error i.e. Curve A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree real-life applications in which classification is useful are: —\nEmail Spam\n1. Response: A qualitative binary indicator whether the email is spam or not spam.\n2. Predictors: Presence of common words in subject of the email (such as offer, lottery etc.), Presence of name of email account holder in text of email, Unverified attachments, Relative frequency of commonly used words.\n3. Goal of the application: Prediction.\n\nHandwriting recognition : ZIP codes on postal envelopes\n1. Response: Each of the 5 digits (0-9) - categorical outcome\n2. Predictors: A matrix corresponding to an image where each pixel corresponds is an entry in the matrix, and its pixel intensity ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white).\n3. Goal of the application: Prediction\n\nFactors Affecting Consumer purchase amongst competing goods : Which factors most affect the consumers’ purchase of a particular product amongst competing brands.\n1. Response: Which one of the competing products does a consumer buy?\n2. Predictors: Area, demographics of buyer, advertising revenues etc.\n3. Goal of the application: Inference.\n\n\n\nThree real-life applications in which regression is useful are: —\n1. Predicting response to dosage of BP medication\ni) Response: Blood Pressure (in mmHg)\nii) Predictors: Dose of a given medication, age, vital indicators etc.\niii) Goal of the application: Prediction\n\n2. Factors affecting Crop Yields\ni) Response: Crop Yield in units per area\nii) Predictors: Amount of fertilizer applied, Soil pH, Temperature, Machines used, etc.\niii) Goal of the application: Both inference (which inputs yield maximum benefits) and prediction (expected crop yield in a particular season)\n\n3. Increasing operational efficiency in a production line by identifying low-hanging fruits\ni) Response: Factory output of a good\nii) Predictors: Various raw materials, number of workers, capital investment, working hours, etc.\niii) Goal of the application: Inference (spending on which input / predictor) will cause maximum increase in output.\n\n\n\nThree real-life applications in which cluster analysis is useful are: —\n1. Social Network Clusters: Identifying like-minded twitter users based on their activity.\n2. Finding Similar books for a book recommendation software based on past purchase data from users.\n3. Gene mapping in evolutionary biology to find clusters of similar genes within a genome / evolutionary lineage.\n\n\n\n\n\nA very flexible approach has following advantages and disadvantages :–\n\n\n\nAdvantages: Allows fitting to highly non-linear relationships. Better performance when \\(n\\) is large and \\(p\\) is small.\nDisadvantages: Requires estimation of a large number of parameters. Low level of interpretability. Can lead to overfitting. Does not perform well when \\(n\\) is very small or data is high-dimensional i.e. large \\(p\\).\n\n\nA more flexible approach may be considered when we have a large data (high \\(n\\)), low dimensionality (low \\(p\\)), or when we are mainly interested in prediction in a non-linear relationship.\nA less flexible approach is preferred when out objective is inference and interpretability of the results. (Or when data is high dimensional or low \\(n\\).)\n\n\n\n\nA parametric statistical learning approach assumes a \\(f(x)\\) i.e. it pre-supposes a functional form for relationship between predictors and response. On the other hand, a non-parametric approach does not assume any functional form for \\(f\\) at all. It just tries to best fit the available data. Thus, it requires a very large amount of data.\n\nParametric approach advantages:\n1) Easier to compute and evaluate\n2) Interpretation is simpler\n3) Better for inference tasks.\n4) Can be used with a low number of observations.\n\nParametric approach disadvantages:\n1) If the underlying relationship is far off from assumed functional form, the method will lead to high error rate.\n2) If too flexible a model fitted, it will lead to overfitting.\n3) Real-life relations are rarely simple functional forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"docs/ISLRCh2Ex2-4Q7.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(y = as.factor(y)) |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_000 = sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2))\ndata |&gt; kbl() |&gt; kable_classic_2(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nx1\nx2\nx3\ny\ndist_000\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n0\nred\n3.000000\n\n\n2\n0\n0\nred\n2.000000\n\n\n0\n1\n3\nred\n3.162278\n\n\n0\n1\n2\ngreen\n2.236068\n\n\n-1\n0\n1\ngreen\n1.414214\n\n\n1\n1\n1\nred\n1.732051\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distance between each test point and the test point (0,0,0) is displayed above, and for the six points is\n3.00 2.00 3.16 2.24 1.41 1.73\n\n\n\nWith \\(K=1\\), our prediction for \\(y\\) is “green”, as the nearest neighbor is “green”.\n\n\n\nWith \\(K=3\\), our prediction for \\(y\\) is “red”, as the nearest neighbors are 1 “green” and 2 “red”.\n\n\n\nIf the Bayes Decision Boundary is highly non-linear, then we would expect the best value of \\(K\\) to be small, because a smaller \\(K\\) allows us more flexibility in the estimated decision boundary."

I’m Aditya Dahiya, an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer navigating the intricate labyrinth of the Indian Administrative Service in the Government of Haryana. While my day job might involve more paperwork than I care to admit, my true passion lies in the world of health data visualization.\nMy journey began with a stethoscope around my neck and a medical degree from the AIIMS, New Delhi, earned from 2005 to 2010. But in 2011, I decided to swap the scrubs for a suit and tie and jumped headfirst into the world of civil service. Fast forward to 2021-22, and I found myself on the hallowed grounds of Harvard University, where I earned an MPH degree, because why not?\nNow, you might wonder how someone with a day job in bureaucracy and a penchant for health data visualization ended up creating solutions for the first edition of “An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R.” Well, my secret lies in seizing those precious moments of free time. And during one such moment, I embarked on a journey of statistical enlightenment by enrolling in Johns Hopkins University’s 140.644.01 - Statistical Machine Learning course.\nThe result? A treasure trove of solutions that I’m delighted to share with you. Whether you’re a fellow learner, an aspiring statistician, or just a curious soul, this website is your go-to resource for unraveling the mysteries of statistical learning, sprinkled with a dash of wit and a pinch of my unique perspective.\nSo, join me on this data-driven adventure at LinkedIn or shoot me an email. Even bureaucrats can have a little statistical swagger!"

Here, the classifier returns the category of response which is most likely, given the values of predictors in \\(N_o\\) i.e. K-nearest neighbors. KNN classifier first identifies the K points in the training data that are closest to \\(x_o\\), represented by \\(\\mathcal{N}_o\\). It then estimates the conditional probability for class \\(j\\) as the fraction of points in \\(\\mathcal{N}_o\\) whose response values equal \\(j\\)\n\\[Pr(Y = j |x=x_o) =  \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{x_i \\in N_o} I(y_i = j)\\]\nFinally, KNN applies Bayes rule and classifies the test observation \\(x_o\\) to the class with the largest probability. - KNN Regression is a method which models continuous outcomes or responses based on predictors. It calculates the predicted outcome as the average of responses for the K-nearest neighbors of the given \\(x_o\\), i.e. :—\n\\[\\hat{f}(x_o) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{x_i \\in N_o} y_i \\] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is incorrect because coefficient \\(\\hat{\\beta}_3\\) is positive, meaning thereby that females (coded as 1) earn more than males _(coded as 0)\n\nThis statement is incorrect because coefficient \\(\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 35\\) is positive, meaning thereby that females (coded as 1) earn more than males _(coded as 0), but only if the GPA is less than 3.5. This is because the coefficient of interaction term for Gender and GPA \\(\\hat{\\beta}_5 = -10\\). Thus above a certain value, males will have higher earnings.\n\nThis statement is correct because coefficient \\(\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 35\\) is positive but the coefficient of interaction term for Gender and GPA \\(\\hat{\\beta}_5 = -10\\), meaning thereby that females (coded as 1) earn more than males (coded as 0) only up to a certain GPA level, above which the males earn more.\n\nThis statement is incorrect for reasons explained above in (iii).\n\n\n\n\nThe salary of a female with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0 is 137.1, as calculated below :–\n\n\\(Salary = \\beta_0 + (\\beta_1*4) + (\\beta_2 * 110) + (\\beta_3*1) + (\\beta_4*110*4) + (\\beta_5*4*1)\\)\n\n\\(Salary = 50 + (20*4) + (0.07 * 110) + (35*1) + (0.01*110*4) + (-10*4*1)\\)\n\n\\(Salary = 137.1\\)\n\n\n\n\nFalse. The magnitude of a coefficient does not tell us anything about the significance of the interaction amongst GPA and IQ. This is because the magnitude / value of a coefficient depends on the units of predictor variables chosen. Rather, the standard error and \\(p\\)-value associated with the coefficient will tell us whether there is any evidence of an interaction or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Training Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) for the cubic regression will always be lower than the simple linear regression, even if the true population model is linear i.e. \\(Y = \\beta_o + \\beta_1(X) + \\epsilon\\). This is because more terms in the cubic regression provide more flexibility and thus allows the model to fit each data point more closely. Thus, the RSS is reduced. This is not good thing for us though, as the cubic regression will lead to overfitting.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Test Residual Sum of Squares, the simple linear regression will have a lower RSS than cubin regression. This happens because our true population model is linear, so cubic regression leads to overfitting. This causes Test RSS to rise, as compared to linear regression.\n\n\n\n\nEven if we do not know the form of true population relation between \\(Y\\) and \\(x\\), the cubic regression will always have a lower Training RSS. This is because the cubic regression is a more flexible model, and thus always fits the training data more closely leading to a lower Training RSS.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Test RSS, when the form true relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(x\\) is unknown, we cannot predict whether the linear regression or cubic regression will perform better. This will be an empirical question. Which of the two models has a lower Test RSS will depend on the exact relation between \\(Y\\) and \\(x\\), and how closely it is modeled by the linear or cubic regression.\n\n\n\n\nIn this question, we are considering the fitted values from a linear regression without an intercept, where\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = x_i \\hat{\\beta_i} \\]\n\nand,\n\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_{i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} y_{i}}{\\sum_{i'=1}^{n} x_{i'}^{2}}\\]\n\nThus, we can easily replace the value of \\(\\hat{\\beta_i}\\) in the equation of \\(y_i\\) and solve for \\(a_i\\) as follows —\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = x_i \\times \\hat{\\beta_i} \\] \\[ \\hat{y}_{i} = x_{i} \\times \\frac{\\sum_{i'=1}^{n} x_{i'} y_{i'}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}^{2}} \\] \\[ \\hat{y}_{i} = \\sum_{i'=1}^{n} \\frac{ x_{i'} y_{i'} \\times x_{i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}^{2}} \\] \\[ \\hat{y}_{i} = \\sum_{i'=1}^{n} \\left ( \\frac{ x_{i} x_{i'} } { \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}^{2} } \\times y_{i'} \\right ) \\]\nThus, we can easily re-write the expression as\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = \\sum_{i'=1}^{n} a_{i'}y_i  \\]\nAs a result, the value of \\(a_i\\) is —\n\\[ a_{i'} = \\frac{ x_{i} x_{i'} } { \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}^{2} } \\]\nAlso, this means that we can interpret this result by saying that the fitted values (\\(\\hat{y_i}\\)) from a linear regression are linear combination of the response values (\\(y_{i'}\\)).\n\n\n\nThe least squares regression line is\n\\[ y_i = \\hat{\\beta_o} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i \\]\nwhere, \\(beta_o\\) and \\(beta_1\\) are defined as —\n\\[\\hat{\\beta_o} = \\overline{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1} \\overline{x}\\] \\[\\hat{\\beta}_{1} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - \\overline{x}) (y_{i}-\\overline{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i}-\\overline{x})^{2}}\\]\nNow, we need to prove that when \\(x_i = \\overline{x}\\), then \\(\\hat{y_i} = \\overline{y}\\). For this, we substitute the value of \\(\\beta_o\\) with \\(\\overline{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1} \\overline{x}\\) and set the value of \\(x_i\\) as \\(\\overline{x}\\),\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_o} + \\hat{\\beta_1}\\overline{x} \\]\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = \\overline{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1} \\overline{x} + \\hat{\\beta_1}\\overline{x} \\]\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = \\overline {y}\\]\nThus, the point (\\(\\overline{x},\\overline{y}\\)) will always lie on the least squares regression line.\n\n\n\n\nKeeping the values of \\(\\overline{x}\\) and \\(\\overline{y}\\) as 0, the terms \\(R^2\\) and \\(Cor(X,Y)\\) are defined as follows \\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}{\\sum(y_j-\\overline{y})^2} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}{\\sum{y_j}^2}\\]\n\\[ Cor(X,Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{n}(x_i-\\overline{x})(y_i-\\overline{y})}{\\sum{x_j} \\sum{y_j}} = \\frac{\\sum_{n}x_iy_i}{\\sum{x_j} \\sum{y_j}}\\]\nNow, keeping \\(\\overline{y}\\) and \\(\\overline{x}\\) as zero, we can substitute the value of \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) in \\(R^2\\) as:—\n\\[ y_i = \\hat{\\beta_o} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x_i = 0+ \\frac{\\sum(x_{i} - 0) (y_{i}-0)}{\\sum(x_{i}-0)^{2}} = \\frac{\\sum{x_iy_i}}{\\sum{x_i}^2}\\]\nThus, we have the following expression for \\(R^2\\), \\[R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_i(y_i - \\sum_jx_jy_j/\\sum_jx_j^2 x_i)^2}{\\sum_jy_j^2}\\] \\[R^2 = \\frac{\\sum_jy_j^2 - (\\sum_iy_i^2 - 2\\sum_iy_i(\\sum_jx_jy_j/\\sum_jx_j^2)x_i + \\sum_i(\\sum_jx_jy_j/\\sum_jx_j^2)^2x_i^2)}{\\sum_jy_j^2}\\] \\[R^2 = \\frac{2(\\sum_ix_iy_i)^2/\\sum_jx_j^2 - (\\sum_ix_iy_i)^2/\\sum_jx_j^2}{\\sum_jy_j^2}\\] \\[ R^2 = \\frac{(\\sum_ix_iy_i)^2}{\\sum_jx_j^2\\sum_jy_j^2} = Cor(X, Y)^2.\\]"

The Normal Q-Q plot also shows evidence on whether the residuals are normal distributed. The current evidence shows that the distribution is somewhat normal. The Spread-Location plot of \\(\\sqrt{standardized \\ residuals}\\) vs. fitted values shows the spread of residuals along the range of predictor values, allowing us to test homoskedasticity. Here, the model fit1 suffers from heteroskedasticity. The last plot of Residuals vs. Leverage shows us whether any observations are high-leverage. Here, none of the observations appear outside the dashed lines and thus there is no influential observation which is altering the results of the regression model.\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(fit1)\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))"

The F-statistic of 252.43 (generated by summary(fit2)$fstatistic[1]) has a p-value of nearly zero.\n\nThe predictors which appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response are displacement, weight, year and origin.\n\nThe coefficient for year is 0.751 (round(fit2$coef[7],3)). This suggests that with each year, the value of miles per gallon mpg increases by 0.75, provided all other variables remain constant. In other words, with each year, fuel efficiency increases by 0.75 [95% CI = 0.65, 0.85] mpg/year if other variables remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n(d)\nThe diagnostic plots for this multiple linear regression are shown below.\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(fit2)\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals vs Fitted Plot shows whether the residuals from multiple linear regression have non-linear patterns. We find that the residuals are not evenly spread around the horizontal line. Perhaps there is some non-linear relationship between the response and predictors, which is not captured by the linear model we have fitted.\nNormal Q-Q Plot shows us whether the residuals are normally distributed. Since, residuals follow the straight line when plotted with theoretical quantiles of a normal distribution, this plot suggests that the residuals are somewhat normally distributed, barring a few observations with high residual values.\nScale-Location Plot checks the assumption of homoskedasticity. The plot suggests some amount of heteroskedasticity.\nResiduals vs Leverage Plot helps us to find influential cases with high leverage and outliers (high absolute standardized residual value). In this data set, around 5 observations like 323, 326, 327, 394 etc. are outliers and observation 14 has a high leverage. But, there is no observation outside of the dashed line, the Cook’s distance, thus there is no observation which is significantly affecting the regression results.\n\n\n\n\n(e)\nTo fit various interaction terms in the Multiple linear regression model, we use two strategies :—\n\n\nFirst, we use three interactions to fit to the model, using the three variable pairs which carry the highest correlation from the correlation matrix shown in part (b) above: \\(displacement \\times cylinders\\) , \\(displacement \\times weight\\) and \\(weight \\times cylinders\\).\nThe results below suggest that only the interaction between displacement and weight is statistically significant.

Thus, interaction terms should be chosen on theoretical basis for interaction effects and then fitted into the model.\n\n\n\n\n(f)\nNow, we fit different types of models using 3 transformations of the predictor and response variables. We use only one predictor variable horsepower for ease of demonstration. The response variable continues to be mpg. We compare the models using plots with the fitted regression line, along with value of \\(R^2\\) in the top of the graph in red font.

Firstly, the coefficient for x2 is non-significant and negative in the multiple regression, but turns positive and highly significant in simple regression. Further, there is very high error in estimate of \\(\\hat{\\beta_2}\\) in the multiple regression (because x2 is correlated with x1, and this collinearity widens the confidence interval). Secondly, the simple regression using only x2 as a predictor displays a large positive coefficient estimate, much more than the true parameter. This is perhaps because x2 is acting as a surrogate for x1 in the simple regression of y onto x2.\nThe situation in questions (c) to (e) present a text book example of collinearity. When two predictors (x1 and x2) are highly correlated, the parameter estimates in multiple linear regression tend to have large standard errors of estimation. This leads to imprecise estimates with wide confidence intervals. Thus, they null hypothesis cannot be rejected in the multiple linear regression. However, simple regression performed after dropping one of the correlated predictors can solve the problem of imprecise estimates. Here, the simple linear regression of either predictor shows them to be highly significant predictors of y. But, we must be wary that simple regression involving such predictors can lead to misleading estimates of the true underlying relationship.\n\n\n\n(g)\nNow, we add a new observation as provided in the question and fit the three models again. The new models are checked for leverage and standardized residual (outlier status) of the new observation. The results are compactly produced in the table produced at the end. We compare the models and find the following results: - In the multiple linear regression model, adding the new observation totally throws off the estimated coefficients for x1 and x2. Adding this observation has a major impact on the re-fitted model. The new observation is an outlier, having an absolute standardized residual &gt; 2 (though it is &lt; 3). The new observation has high leverage, and thus a high influence on the re-fitted model. This is shown in the diagnostic plots as well. Lastly, this means that a fitted model with high collinearity is not robust, it is very vulnerable to misread observations. - In the simple linear regression model with x1 as predictor, adding the new observation has very low impact on the coefficients. The new observation is an extreme outlier, with an absolute standardized residual greater than 3. However, the new observation has a very low leverage, and thus, it is not influential on the re-fitted model at all. - In the simple linear regression model with x2 as predictor, adding the new observation has a moderate to low impact on the coefficients. The new observation is not an outlier, and thus even though it has somewhat high leverage, it has no major influence on the fitted model.\n\nx1 &lt;- c(x1, 0.1)\nx2 &lt;- c(x2, 0.8)\ny &lt;- c(y, 6)\nfit23new &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)\nfit24new &lt;- lm(y ~ x1)\nfit25new &lt;- lm(y ~ x2)\nResult &lt;- data.frame(\n  Model = c(\n    \"y~x1+x2\", \"y~x1+x2 new\", \"y~x1\",\n    \"y~x1 new\", \"y~x2\", \"y~x2 new\"\n  ),\n  Intercept = rep(NA, 6), Beta_x1 = rep(NA, 6),\n  Beta_x2 = rep(NA, 6), Leverage = rep(NA, 6),\n  Standardized_Residual = rep(NA, 6)\n)\nResult[1, 2:4] &lt;- fit23$coefficients\nResult[2, 2:4] &lt;- fit23new$coefficients\nResult[3, 2:3] &lt;- fit24$coefficients\nResult[4, 2:3] &lt;- fit24new$coefficients\nResult[5, c(2, 4)] &lt;- fit25$coefficients\nResult[6, c(2, 4)] &lt;- fit25new$coefficients\n\n# Code to find Leverage of the new observation\nsum(hatvalues(fit23new) &gt; 2 * mean(hatvalues(fit23new)))\n\n[1] 2\n\nwhich.max(hatvalues(fit23new))\n\n101 \n101 \n\nResult[2, 5] &lt;- hatvalues(fit23new)[101]\nwhich(abs(rstudent(fit23new)) &gt; 2)\n\n 16  21  55  82 101 \n 16  21  55  82 101 \n\nResult[2, 6] &lt;- rstudent(fit23new)[101]\nsum(hatvalues(fit24new) &gt; 2 * mean(hatvalues(fit24new)))\n\n[1] 3\n\nwhich.max(hatvalues(fit24new))\n\n27 \n27 \n\nResult[4, 5] &lt;- hatvalues(fit24new)[101]\nwhich(abs(rstudent(fit24new)) &gt; 2)\n\n 21  55  56  82 101 \n 21  55  56  82 101 \n\nResult[4, 6] &lt;- rstudent(fit24new)[101]\nsum(hatvalues(fit25new) &gt; 2 * mean(hatvalues(fit25new)))\n\n[1] 8\n\nwhich.max(hatvalues(fit25new))\n\n101 \n101 \n\nResult[6, 5] &lt;- hatvalues(fit25new)[101]\nwhich(abs(rstudent(fit25new)) &gt; 2)\n\n 5 21 55 82 \n 5 21 55 82 \n\nResult[6, 6] &lt;- rstudent(fit25new)[101]\n\n\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nknitr::kable(Result, digits = 3) %&gt;% kable_classic_2()\n\n\n\n\nModel\nIntercept\nBeta_x1\nBeta_x2\nLeverage\nStandardized_Residual\n\n\n\n\ny~x1+x2\n2.130\n1.440\n1.010\nNA\nNA\n\n\ny~x1+x2 new\n2.227\n0.539\n2.515\n0.415\n2.113\n\n\ny~x1\n2.112\n1.976\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\ny~x1 new\n2.257\n1.766\nNA\n0.033\n3.438\n\n\ny~x2\n2.390\nNA\n2.900\nNA\nNA\n\n\ny~x2 new\n2.345\nNA\n3.119\n0.101\n1.141\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(fit23new)\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(fit24new)\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(fit25new)"

Thus, taking its log and calling it \\(\\delta_k(x)\\), \\[ \\delta_k(x) = log(\\pi_k) -\\frac{(x-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\] \\[ \\delta_k(x) = log(\\pi_k) -\\frac{x^2 + \\mu_k^2 -2x\\mu_k}{2\\sigma^2}\\] \\[ \\delta_k(x) = log(\\pi_k) -\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\mu_k^2}{{2\\sigma^2}} +\\frac{x\\mu_k}{\\sigma^2}\\] Further, the expression \\(\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\) does not vary with the class \\(k\\), thus can be ignored, giving us the final expression: \\[ \\delta_k(x) = x.\\frac{\\mu_k}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\mu_k^2}{{2\\sigma^2}} \\ + \\ log(\\pi_k)  \\qquad \\qquad (4.13)\\]\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nFor this question, since we are assuming that in \\(1 \\ to \\ k\\) classes, \\(\\sigma_1^2 \\not= \\sigma_2^2 \\not= \\ ...\\ \\not= \\sigma_k^2\\), thus we replace \\(\\sigma^2\\) in equations above with \\(\\sigma_k^2\\) and repeat the same steps to get — \\[ \\delta_k(x) = log(\\pi_k) -\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma_k^2} - \\frac{\\mu_k^2}{{2\\sigma_k^2}} +\\frac{x\\mu_k}{\\sigma_k^2}\\] None of these terms can now be ignored, as all will vary with \\(k\\), thus the final expression becomes quadratic in \\(x\\) as follows: \\[ \\delta_k(x) = -x^2 . \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_k^2} +x.\\frac{\\mu_k}{\\sigma_k^2} - \\frac{\\mu_k^2}{{2\\sigma_k^2}} + log(\\pi_k)\\]\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nThe question is aimed at demonstration of the Curse of Dimensionality, which refers to the fact that then \\(p\\) is large, non-parametric approaches like \\(KNN\\), which depend of finding the training values nearest to a given test value of the predictors, will perform poorly.\n\n(a)\nThe question refers to a situation in which \\(p=1\\) and predictor X has a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, i.e. \\(x = U(0,1)\\). Thus, for any interval the proportion of observations within the interval $ [x - 0.05, x + 0.05]$ will be equal to ratio of length of interval to range of distribution. Now, the question tells us that the interval is 10% of the range of distribution. Thus, on average 0.1 (10%) of the observations will lie in the interval and will be used to make the prediction.\n\\[ Fraction \\ of\\ observations \\ in \\ KNN = \\frac{range\\ of\\ interval}{range \\ of\\ distribution} = \\frac {0.1}{1} = 0.1\\] If we are willing to consider a more nuanced approach, we realize that within the interval \\([0.05, 0.95]\\) the same principal holds, but for the intervals \\([0, 0.05] \\ , [0.95, 1]\\), slight difference will occur. + For \\(x &lt; 0.05\\), the observations considered will be \\((100x + 5)\\)% of the total observations. + For \\(x &gt; 0.95\\), the observations considered will be \\(105 - 100x\\)% of the total observations. Hence, we can compute the percentage of observations in the interval on average as: \\[\\int_{0.05}^{0.95}10 dx + \\int_0^{0.05}(100x + 5)dx + \\int_{0.95}^1(105 - 100x)dx = 9 + 0.375 + 0.375 = 9.75 %\\] However, we stick to the figure of 0.1 fo simplicity in further sections.\n\n\n\n(b)\nNow, the two variables are both \\(U(0,1)\\) distributed, and thus the distribution can be considered as evenly spread over square with both sides equal to 1. The probability distribution function is uniform, and thus evenly spread over the entire area. Hence, the fraction of observations in any given interval area will be \\(area \\ of \\ interval / area \\ of \\ the \\ range\\ of\\ distribution\\). For the interval of 10% of range of each variable, on average \\(\\frac{0.1 \\times 0.1}{1} = \\frac{0.1^2}{1} = 0.01\\) observations will be used to make the prediction.\n\n\n\n(c)\nContinuing on with the previous trend, if \\(p=100\\), and the interval used for prediction is 10% of the range of each variable, a total of \\(\\frac{0.1^{100}}{1} = 10^{-100} \\approx 0\\) fraction of the observations will be used to make a prediction.\n\n\n\n(d)\nThe answers to (a) to (c) above clearly show that a negligible fraction of observations will remain within the interval to be considered for prediction as the value of \\(p\\) increases.\n\n\n\n(e)\nLet us suppose \\(a\\) is the side of the hyper-cube. We need 10% (or, 0.1) of the observations. + For \\(p=1\\), to use 10% of the observations, we need \\(a^1 = 0.1\\). Thus, \\(a = 0.1\\). + For \\(p=2\\), to use 10% of the observations, we need \\(a^2 = 0.1\\). Thus, \\(a = \\sqrt{0.1} = 0.316\\). + For \\(p=10\\), to use 10% of the observations, we need \\(a^{10} = 0.1\\). Thus, \\(a = \\sqrt[10]{0.1} = 0.79\\). + For \\(p=100\\), to use 10% of the observations, we need \\(a^{100} = 0.1\\). Thus, \\(a = \\sqrt[100]{0.1} = 0.977\\). The answers show that with increasing \\(k\\), we end up using the entire range of each variable to make a prediction interval large enough to contain 10% of observations.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n(a)\nIf the Bayes Decision boundary is linear, we expect: + On the training set, QDA will nearly always perform better because it can better fit the variations in individual points. + On the test set, LDA is expected to perform better, because QDA will tend to over-fit to the noise. The Bayes Boundary will be better approximated by the LDA, and thus LDA will have lower test error rate.\n\n\n\n(b)\nIf the Bayes Decision boundary is linear, we expect: + On the training set, QDA will nearly always perform better because it can better fit the variations in individual points. + On the test set, QDA is expected to perform better, because LDA will suffer from higher bias. The non-linear Bayes Boundary will be better approximated by the QDA, and thus QDA will have lower test error rate.\n\n\n\n(c)\nIn general, as the sample size \\(n\\) increases, we are less concerned with the variance of the fitted model since we have a large number of observations to train the model on. Rather, we will be more concerned with the bias of the model which does not go away even after \\(n\\) is increased. Thus, we expect the test prediction accuracy of QDA relative to LDA to improve as \\(n\\) increases.\n\n\n\n(d)\nThe statement is FALSE. If the Bayes Decision Boundary for a given problem is linear, then on the test set, a more flexible model will end up overfitting and fit to the noise in the training data, over and above the true trends. This will reduce its accuracy when it is used on test data. Thus, QDA is not always guaranteed to achieve loer test error rates, especially if the Bayes decision boundary is linear.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nThe estimated logistic regression model can be written in equation form as: \\[ log(odds \\ of \\ receiving \\ an \\ A) = -6 \\ + \\ 0.05 \\times(hours \\ studied) \\ + \\ 1 \\times(undergrad \\ GPA)  \\]\n\n\n(a)\nThe estimated log(odds) for this student are -0.5 (-6+(0.05*40)+3.5) and 0.38 ( exp(-0.5)/(1+exp(-0.5)) ). \\[ log(odds \\ of \\ receiving \\ an \\ A) = -6 \\ + \\ 0.05 \\times(40) \\ + \\ 1 \\times(3.5) = -0.5 \\] \\[ odds \\ of \\ receiving \\ an \\ A = e^{-0.5} = 0.607 \\] \\[ Probability \\ of \\ receiving \\ A = \\frac{odds}{1+odds} = \\frac{0.607}{1.607} = 0.38\\]\n\n\n\n\n(b)\nFor getting 50% probability, the odds will have to be $ = = 1$. Thus, log(odds) will be \\(log(1) = 0\\). So, suppose the student studies for \\(x\\) hours, the equation may be re-written as: \\[ 0 = -6 \\ + \\ 0.05 \\times(x) \\ + \\ 1 \\times(3.5) \\] \\[ 0.05 \\times(x) = 6 - 3.5 = 2.5 \\] \\[ x = \\frac {2.5}{0.05} = 50  \\]\nThus, the student needs to study for 50 hours.\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\nThe question assumes normal distribution for \\(X\\). The given values by the question are: \\[ \\mu_{yes} = 10 \\ \\ ; \\ \\mu_{no} = 0 \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 36 \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\pi_{yes} = 0.8 \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\pi_{no} = 0.2  \\] We now plug in these values into the formula obtained in \\((4.12)\\) after applying Bayes’ Theorem. \\[ p_k(x) = \\frac {\\pi_k \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\ exp{(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}{(x-\\mu_k)^2})}}{\\sum_{l = 1}^K\\pi_l \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\ exp{(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}{(x-\\mu_k)^2})}} \\qquad \\qquad (4.12)\\] \\[ p_{yes}(4) = \\frac {\\pi_{yes} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\ exp{(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}{(4 -\\mu_{yes})^2})}}{\\pi_{no} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\ exp{(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}{(4 -\\mu_{no})^2})} + \\pi_{yes} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\ exp{(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}{(4 -\\mu_{yes})^2}}} \\] \\[ p_{yes}(4) = \\frac{0.8 \\times exp(-\\frac {(4-10)^2}{2 \\times 36})}\n{0.2 \\times exp(-\\frac {(4-0)^2}{2 \\times 36}) + 0.8 \\times exp(-\\frac {(4-10)^2}{2 \\times 36}) }  .\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}} \\]\n\\[ p_{yes}(4) = \\frac{0.8 \\times exp({-1/2})}\n{0.2 \\times exp(-16/72) + 0.8 \\times exp(-1/2) } \\] \\[ p_{yes}(4) = 0. 752\\]\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n(a)\nLet the fraction of people who default = \\(p\\). Fraction of people who do not default is \\(1-p\\). Then, odds of defaulting is \\(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\). So, we calculate p = 0.27 as shown below. \\[ \\frac{p}{1-p} = 0.37\\] \\[ \\frac{1-p}{p} = \\frac{1}{0.37}\\] \\[ \\frac{1}{p} -1 = \\frac{1}{0.37}\\] \\[ \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{1}{0.37} + 1 = \\frac{1 + 0.37}{0.37} \\] \\[ p = \\frac{0.37}{1.37} = 0.27 \\]\n\n\n\n(b)\nThe Odds of an event is the ratio of probability of event happening to the probability of event not happening.

Here j = 4. We repeatedly create bootstrap samples, and each time we record whether or not the fourth observation is contained in the bootstrap sample. Comment on the results obtained.\nThe R-code and results are displayed below. The Code contains an implementation of a bootstrap method, where we take 10,000 samples (each containing 100 numbers) from the list of first 100 positive integers 1,2,3,…,100 with replacement. We then check whether the sample contains the integer 4. We then find whether each sample contains digit 4, and store the result (TRUE or FALSE) in the \\(i^{th}\\) value of store vector. The mean of store then gives the probability that a bootstrap of size n=100 contains the 4th observation.\n\nstore &lt;- rep(NA, 10000)\nfor (i in 1:10000) {\n  store[i] &lt;- sum(sample(1:100, replace = TRUE) == 4) &gt; 0\n}\nmean(store)\n## [1] 0.6311\n\nThe results reconcile with out calculated probability. It is very close to 0.632. Further, a known formula from Calculus states that: \\[\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}(1 + \\ ^x/_n \\ )^n = e^x\\] Here, \\(x=-1\\), and thus the expression is equivalent to \\(e^{-1}\\), which is 0.368. So, \\(1 - e^{-1}\\) is 0.632 which is the calculated answer for previous two questions."

The error rate is calculated, say \\(e_1\\).\nThen, the second fold fold \\(X_2\\) is used as as the test set, and the remaining \\(k-1\\) folds combined, i.e. \\(X_1 + X_3 +... + X_k\\), are used as the training set. The error rate is calculated, say \\(e_2\\)\nThis step is repeated for all \\(k\\) folds.\nThe average error rate is then used as the k-fold cross validation error rate: \\[ e = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} e_i \\]\n\n\n\n(b)\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of k-fold cross validation relative to:\n\ni. compared to the validation set approach?\nAdvantages of k-fold cross validation\n\nThe error rate is less variable. In validation set approach, the error rate is highly variable and depends on the specific validation and testing set chosen.\nWhen \\(k&gt;2\\), the k-fold cross validation yields more accurate estimates of the test error rate. This is because the validation set approach breaks up the data set into a validation set and a testing set. Due to lower number of observations in the validation set, the model gets to be trained on fewer observations. So, it overestimates the true error rates. In contrast, k-fold cross validation uses a larger training set, and somewhat ameliorates this situation.\n\n\nDisadvantages of k-fold cross validation\nIt is computationally more intensive, as the model needs to be fitted \\(k\\) times. But this is not a major concern in today’s computers.\n\n\nii. compared to LOOCV?\nAdvantages of k-fold cross validation\n\nAs compared to LOOCV, k-fold cross validation is computationally less expensive (when \\(k &lt; n\\)) because the model needs to be fitted a fewer number of times. A sole exception is linear regression, where a shortcut formula exists for calculating the LOOCV error rate using leverage value \\(h_i\\) of each observation.\nLOOCV averages the error rates over \\(n\\) different models, each run on a training set consisting of \\(n-1\\) observations. Since the training set of each LOOCV model is nearly identical, the error rates tend to be highly correlated. The average of highly correlated terms exhibits high variance. Thus, the LOOCV estimate suffers from high variance.\n\nDisadvantages of k-fold cross validation\n\nEach LOOCV model uses \\(n-1\\) observations to fit the model, and thus uses a training set which is nearly identical to the original data set. Thus, LOOCV suffers from a very low bias. Hence, in terms of accuracy of the estimated error rate, LOOCV performs better when bias of the estimate is a major concern.\nOverall, empirical evidence suggests that k-fold cross validation with \\(k=5\\) or \\(k=10\\) performs best considering this bias-variance trade off."

    "text": "Question 1\n\n(a)\nWhich of the three models with \\(k\\) predictors has the smallest training RSS?\nThe Best Subset Selection model will have the smallest training RSS. The reasoning is that for the model with \\(k\\) predictors:\n\nThe Best Subset Selection model with \\(k\\) predictors is the best one out of \\(p\\choose{k}\\) models with \\(k\\) predictors. It has lowest training Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) amongst these models.\nThe Forward Step-wise Selection model with \\(k\\) predictors is the best out of only \\((p-k)\\) models which augment the predictors in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k-1}\\) model.\nThe Backward Step-wise Selection model with \\(k\\) predictors is the best one amongst \\(k\\) models that contain all but one less predictor than the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model.\nThus, amongst the three, Best Subset Selection chooses this model from the widest possible option list of models with \\(k\\) predictors. So, it will always have the smallest training RSS.\n\n\n\n(b)\nWhich of the three models with k predictors has the smallest test RSS?\nIt is difficult to predict, as any of the three models could have the lowest test RSS. The Test RSS is totally different than Training RSS. A model with \\(k\\) parameters which has the lowest training RSS (in this case, the Best Subset Selection model) could easily overfit the training data leading to a misleadingly low Training RSS, but a very high Test RSS.\nThus, at large values of \\(k\\) (\\(k \\approx n\\)), overfitting will lead to Best Subset Selection models with lowest training RSS to have a high Test RSS. Hence, any of the three models could have smallest Test RSS depending on the specific situation and value of \\(k\\).\n\n\n(c)\nTrue or False:\ni. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k+1)-variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.\nTRUE. The \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model in Forward stepwise selection is chosen by adding a predictor to the existing \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model, after considering the best amongst \\(p-k\\) models that can augment the existing \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model. So, the predictors in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model identified by forward stepwise selection will always be a subset of the predictors in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model.\nii. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k+1)-variable model identified by backward stepwise selection.\nTRUE. The \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model in Backward stepwise selection is chosen by dropping one predictor from the existing \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model, after considering the best amongst \\(k\\) model options (each of which drops a different predictor). So, the predictors in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model identified by Backward stepwise selection will always be a subset of the predictors in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model.\niii. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)-variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.\nFALSE. The \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model in Backward stepwise selection is reached after consecutively dropping \\(p-k\\) predictors, one at each step, starting from the full model \\(\\mathcal{M}_{p}\\). In contrast, the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model in Forward stepwise selection is arrived at by consecutively adding a predictor at each step to the Null Model \\(\\mathcal{M}_{0}\\). There is no guarantee that the iterations in these two different algorithms will arrive at the same set of predictors for each value of \\(k\\). Hence, the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model in Backward stepwise selection could contain some predictors which have not yet been added into the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model of Forward stepwise selection.\niv. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k+1)-variable model identified by backward stepwise selection.\nFALSE. The \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) model in Forward stepwise selection is reached after adding a predictor at each of the \\(k\\) steps to the initial Null Model \\(\\mathcal{M}_{0}\\). On the other hand, the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model in Backward stepwise selection is reached after consecutively dropping \\(p-(k+1)\\) predictors, one at each step, starting from the full model \\(\\mathcal{M}_{p}\\). There is no guarantee that the iterations in these two different algorithms will arrive at the same set of predictors for each value of \\(k\\). Hence, the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model in Forward stepwise selection could contain some predictors which have already been dropped from the \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model of Backward stepwise selection.\nv. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by best subset are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)-variable model identified by best subset selection.\nFALSE. The \\(k\\)-variable Best subset selection model (\\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\)) is selected after comparing the full set of \\(p\\choose{k}\\) models containing \\(k\\) predictors. This selection process is not based on the models \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) , \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k-1}\\) or any other model. Thus, there is no guarantee that all of the predictors contained in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) will be present in \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) model as well."

    "text": "Question 2\n\n(a)\nFor lasso, answer is (iii). Lasso is less flexible than least squares regression. It produces a sparse model and lowers the variance of the coefficients. The reduced flexibility does lead to some increase in bias. Thus, Lasso will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias (more accurately, Bias Squared) is less than its decrease in variance.\n\n\n(b)\nFor ridge regression, answer is again (iii). Ridge Regression is shrinkage method like Lasso. It will constrain or regularize all the coefficients towards zero, thereby decreasing their variance. Thus, it is less flexible than least squares regression. The reduced flexibility does lead to some increase in bias. Thus, Ridge regression will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias (more accurately, Bias Squared) is less than its decrease in variance.\n\n\n(c)\nFor non-linear methods, the answer is (ii). Non-linear methods are more flexible than linear least squares regression, since they allow the fit to vary over different portions of the predictor set. This leads to a lower bias, but higher variance in the estimates produced by non-linear methods. Hence, non-linear methods will give improved prediction accuracy when the increase in variance is less than its decrease in bias (or, more accurately, Bias-squared)."

Training RSS will steadily decrease. As we increase \\(s\\) from 0, the \\(l_1\\) norm of the estimated coefficients will increase. Thus, the coefficients will increase in magnitude away from the Null model (at \\(s=0\\)). As a result, the training RSS will decrease steadily.\n\n\n(b)\nAnswer is (ii). As we increase \\(s\\) from 0, and move towards higher values of \\(s\\), we are increasingly moving from a Null model towards the least squares regression model. The intermediate models will be of the lasso form, with regularized coefficients to reduce variance. The test MSE will initially decrease (null model will have high Test MSE) but will eventually increase when \\(s \\to \\infty\\) (least squares model) due to higher variance in coefficient estimates.

The training RSS will steadily increase. The model with \\(\\lambda = 0\\) corresponds to the least squares model (which minimizes Residual Sum of Squares on the training data set), while the model with \\(\\lambda \\to \\infty\\) corresponds to the Null Model (which has the highest training RSS, equivalent to Total Sum of Squares TSS).

As we increase \\(\\lambda\\) from 0, and move towards higher values of \\(\\lambda\\), we are if effect, moving from a Least Squares Regression model towards the NULL model.

At \\(\\lambda = 0\\), the least squares model has the highest variance amongst all values of \\(\\lambda\\). At \\(\\lambda \\to \\infty\\), the Null model will have zero variance as it only predicts a single value \\(\\overline{y}\\) for all observations.

Thus, variance will steadily decrease with rising \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\n(d)\nAnswer is (iii). (Squared) Bias will steadily increase. At \\(\\lambda = 0\\), the least squares model is unbiased. Thus squared bias is zero. At \\(\\lambda \\to \\infty\\), the Null model will have the highest bias of all models, as it ignores all predictors, and predicts \\(\\overline{y}\\) for all observations.

The coefficients found using lasso at the optimal \\(\\lambda\\) are quite close to the actual values i.e. \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = 6.01\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = 4.9\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta_2} = 4.01\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_3} = 2.98\\).\n\n# Loading library and creating X matrix and Y vector\nlibrary(glmnet)\nX = model.matrix(y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3) + I(x^4) + I(x^5) + \n                     I(x^6) + I(x^7) + I(x^8) + I(x^9) + I(x^10), \n                     data = sim)[,-1]\nY = sim$y\n\n# Fitting the Lasso model on training set\nlasso.mod = glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 1)\n\n# Using Cross-Validation Lasso, displaying optimal value of lambda\ncv.lasso = cv.glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 1)\nbestlam = cv.lasso$lambda.min\nbestlam\n\n[1] 0.03346741\n\n# Plotting Cross-Validation Error as a function of lambda\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\nplot(cv.lasso)\n\n\n\n# Displaying resulting coefficients at optimal lambda value\ncoefs = predict(lasso.mod, type = \"coefficients\", s = bestlam)[1:10,]\ncoefs\n\n(Intercept)           x      I(x^2)      I(x^3)      I(x^4)      I(x^5) \n   6.000538    4.896203    4.025918    2.986646    0.000000    0.000000 \n     I(x^6)      I(x^7)      I(x^8)      I(x^9) \n   0.000000    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 \n\n# Displaying only non-zero coefficients\nround(coefs[coefs != 0], 2)\n\n(Intercept)           x      I(x^2)      I(x^3) \n       6.00        4.90        4.03        2.99 \n\n\n\n\n(f)\nWe now prepare the new model, where \\(\\beta_0 = 2\\) and \\(\\beta_7 = 3\\), as follows:\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 \\ + \\ \\beta_7X^7 \\ + \\epsilon\\] \\[ Y = 2 \\ + \\ 3X^7 \\ + \\epsilon\\]\nThen, we perform the best subset selection and lasso.\nFirst, on performing the best subset selection, we find that the BIC and \\(C_p\\) determine the best model to be one with 3 predictors: \\(X^4\\), \\(X^6\\) and \\(X^7\\). This predicts \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = 1.95\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_7} = 2.99\\), which are quite close to true values.

The code is shown below. The results indicate that the best model selected by cv.glmnet() function correctly identifies \\(\\beta_7\\) as the only significant predictor. The coefficient values of the selected lasso model are \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} = 1.76\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_7} = 2.91\\), which are slightly inaccurate with respect to the intercept. But, there are no irrelevant predictors included in the model, which provides the advantage of ease of interpretation.\nThese results indicate that lasso performs better than best subset selection when only a few of the predictor variables are actually related to the response. Lasso does a much better job in producing a sparse model which aids interpretability. However, if prediction accuracy is the sole purpose, or if many predictors are associated with the response, then Best Subset Selection can often outperform lasso.\n\nlibrary(glmnet)\nX1 = model.matrix(y1 ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3) + I(x^4) + I(x^5) + \n                     I(x^6) + I(x^7) + I(x^8) + I(x^9) + I(x^10), \n                     data = sim1)[,-1]\nY1 = sim1$y1\n\n# Fitting the Lasso model on training set\nlasso.mod1 = glmnet(X1, Y1, alpha = 1)\n\n# Using Cross-Validation Lasso, displaying optimal value of lambda\ncv.lasso1 = cv.glmnet(X1, Y1, alpha = 1)\nbestlam1 = cv.lasso$lambda.min\nbestlam1\n\n[1] 0.03346741\n\n# Displaying resulting coefficients at optimal lambda value\ncoefs1 = predict(lasso.mod1, type = \"coefficients\", s = bestlam1)[1:10,]\ncoefs1\n\n(Intercept)           x      I(x^2)      I(x^3)      I(x^4)      I(x^5) \n   1.762545    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 \n     I(x^6)      I(x^7)      I(x^8)      I(x^9) \n   0.000000    2.910907    0.000000    0.000000 \n\n# Displaying only non-zero coefficients\nround(coefs1[coefs1 != 0], 2)\n\n(Intercept)      I(x^7) \n       1.76        2.91"

First, we create a matrix X with 20 random variables X1, X2, ... ,X20 over 1000 observations. We also create an \\(\\epsilon\\) (error term) called eps. Now, we make a simulated Y which is dependent on even numbered columns / variables of X. For ease, we make all coefficients \\(\\beta_j = 3\\). Finally, we combine X and Y into a simulated data set sim.\n\n# Creating predictors and error term\nX &lt;- rnorm(n = 20 * 1000)\nX &lt;- matrix(X,\n  nrow = 1000, ncol = 20,\n  dimnames = list(NULL, paste(\"X\", c(1:20), sep = \"\"))\n)\neps &lt;- rnorm(1000)\n\n# Creating a simulated response Y that is only related to even numbered predictors\n# Keeping all coefficients = 3 (for ease of remembering and comparing later)\n\npredictors &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 2) # vector of actual predictor columns\ncoeffs &lt;- rep(3, 10) # vector of coefficients, all equal to 3\n\nY &lt;- X[, predictors] %*% coeffs + eps\n\n# Creating the data.frame 'sim'\nSim &lt;- data.frame(cbind(Y, X))\ncolnames(Sim)[1] &lt;- \"Y\"\n\n\n\n(b)\nWe now split the data set sim into a training set of 100 observations Train.Sim, and a testing set of 900 observation Test.Sim.\n\n# Create boolean vector train to split into training data (100) and test data (900)\nset.seed(3)\ntrain = sample(x = 1:nrow(Sim), size = 100, replace = FALSE)\n\n# Create Training and Test Subsets of data.frame\nTrain.Sim = Sim[train, ]\nTest.Sim = Sim[-train, ]\n\n\n\n(c)\nWe now perform the Best Subset Selection on the training set. For this, initially we load the library leaps which contains the regsubsets() function to perform best subset selection. Then, we create training matrix TrainX (we could bypass this redundancy using original X variable, but proceeding this way using the split data frame keeps things simple). We also create a TrainY vector to use in regsubsets(). The rss component of the summary of regsubsets() created object contains Residual Sum of Squares. We divide these by n (number of training observations) to obtain Training MSE. The plot of Training MSE, as expected, shows that minimum training MSE is achieved with the model having maximum predictors (\\(p=20\\)).\n\n# Load libraries, and create matrices and vector for regsubsets()\nlibrary(leaps)\nTrainX &lt;- model.matrix(Y ~ ., data = Train.Sim)\nTrainY &lt;- Train.Sim$Y\n\n# Running a Best Subset Selection on Training Data Set\nregfit.best &lt;- regsubsets(TrainX, TrainY, nvmax = 20)\n\nReordering variables and trying again:\n\n# Calculating Training MSE\nTrain.MSE &lt;- rep(NA, 20)\nfor (i in 1:20) {\n  coefs &lt;- coef(regfit.best, id = i)\n  Pred.Y.Train &lt;- TrainX[, names(coefs)] %*% coefs\n  Train.MSE[i] &lt;- mean((TrainY - Pred.Y.Train)^2)\n}\nplot(Train.MSE,\n  type = \"b\", col = \"blue\",\n  xlab = \"Number of Predictors in model\",\n  ylab = \"Training MSE\"\n)\npoints(\n  x = which.min(Train.MSE),\n  y = min(Train.MSE),\n  col = \"blue\", cex = 2, pch = 20\n)\nlegend(x = 5, y = 50, \"Training MSE\", col = \"blue\", lty = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\nNow, we compute the Test MSE using the best models (for each number of predictors selected by the Best Subset Selection Method).

Thus, best subset selection method has correctly picked the correct number of predictors in the best model. Further, it has even correctly identified the 10 relevant predictors as the even numbered predictors. The coefficient values are also very close to the actual value of 3.

The coefficient values displayed below are very close to the actual coefficient value of 3 for each of the predictors (ranging from 2.84 to 3.17). Though, the model does add an unnecessary intercept of 0.17. Overall, the best subset selection does an excellent job.\n\nround(coef(regfit.best, id = which.min(Test.MSE)),2)\n\n(Intercept)          X2          X3          X4          X5          X6 \n      -0.15        3.00        0.03        2.99        0.07        3.00 \n         X7          X8          X9         X10         X11         X12 \n       0.04        3.03       -0.07        2.74       -0.15        2.97 \n        X13         X14         X15         X16         X17         X18 \n      -0.08        2.85       -0.03        3.03        0.02        2.85 \n        X19         X20 (Intercept) \n       0.13        3.09        0.00 \n\n\n\n\n(g)\nWe now create a plot of the following quantity \\(\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{p} (\\beta_j - \\hat{\\beta_j^r})^2}\\) versus the number of predictors in each of the models selected by Best Subset Selection.

Right from the part (a), we will split the data into equally sized training and test sets. However, in question (b) when propose the best model, we will fit the model we select at the end of this part (a) to the entire data set to get the best coefficient estimates.\n\n# Loading libraries and examining data set\nlibrary(MASS)\ndata(\"Boston\")\nBoston &lt;- na.omit(Boston)\ndim(Boston)\n\n[1] 506  14\n\nnames(Boston)\n\n [1] \"crim\"    \"zn\"      \"indus\"   \"chas\"    \"nox\"     \"rm\"      \"age\"    \n [8] \"dis\"     \"rad\"     \"tax\"     \"ptratio\" \"black\"   \"lstat\"   \"medv\"   \n\n# Create a training and test set for `Boston` data set\nset.seed(3)\ntrain &lt;- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), size = nrow(Boston), replace = TRUE)\ntable(train)\n\ntrain\nFALSE  TRUE \n  252   254 \n\n# Creating Test & Train X matrices and Y vectors to use in fitting models\nTrainX &lt;- model.matrix(crim ~ ., data = Boston[train, ])\nTrainY &lt;- Boston$crim[train]\nTestX &lt;- model.matrix(crim ~ ., data = Boston[!train, ])\nTestY &lt;- Boston$crim[!train]\n\nInitially, we start with Best Subset Selection. The best subset selection model statistics \\(C_p\\) and B.I.C. suggest using the model with 3 predictors rad, black and lstat. However, the validation set approach and the 10-fold Cross Validation approach pick up the best model as the one with 9 predictors: zn, indus, nox, dis, rad, ptratio, black, lstat and medv. The lowest Test MSE achieved is 39.33 with 10-fold CV in 9-variable model and 37.06 in Validation-Set approach.\n\nlibrary(leaps)\nfit.bss &lt;- regsubsets(crim ~ ., data = Boston[train, ], nvmax = 13)\n\n# Examining the best model based on fitted model statistics\npar(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(5, 2, 3, 1))\nplot(summary(fit.bss)$bic,\n  type = \"b\", col = \"blue\", xlab = \"Model Predictors\",\n  ylab = \"\", main = \"B.I.C\"\n)\npoints(\n  x = which.min(summary(fit.bss)$bic), y = min(summary(fit.bss)$bic),\n  col = \"blue\", pch = 20, cex = 2\n)\nplot(summary(fit.bss)$cp,\n  type = \"b\", col = \"red\", xlab = \"Model Predictors\",\n  ylab = \"\", main = \"Cp\"\n)\npoints(\n  x = which.min(summary(fit.bss)$cp), y = min(summary(fit.bss)$cp),\n  col = \"red\", pch = 20, cex = 2\n)\nplot(summary(fit.bss)$adjr2,\n  type = \"b\", col = \"purple\", xlab = \"Model Predictors\",\n  ylab = \"\", main = \"Adjusted R-Squared\"\n)\npoints(\n  x = which.max(summary(fit.bss)$adjr2), y = max(summary(fit.bss)$adjr2),\n  col = \"purple\", pch = 20, cex = 2\n)\n\n\n\n# Displaying best model based on fitted model statistics\nround(coef(fit.bss, id = 3), 2)\n\n(Intercept)         rad       black       lstat \n       1.26        0.46       -0.02        0.27 \n\n# Computing Test MSE using a self-created function\npredict.regsubsets &lt;- function(object, newdata, id, ...) {\n  formula &lt;- as.formula(object$call[[2]]) # Extracting formula from regsubsets object\n  cofs &lt;- coef(object, id) # Extracting coefficients with their names\n  testmat &lt;- model.matrix(formula, data = newdata) # Create test X matrix\n  testmat[, names(cofs)] %*% cofs # Predicted values\n}\n\n# Finding best model (lowest Test MSE) as per Validation Set Approach\nModelsMSE &lt;- rep(NA, 13)\nfor (i in 1:13) {\n  pred.bss &lt;- predict.regsubsets(fit.bss, newdata = Boston[!train, ], id = i)\n  ModelsMSE[i] &lt;- mean((TestY - pred.bss)^2)\n}\n\n# Finding the best model (lowest Test MSE) by 10-fold Cross-Validation\nset.seed(3)\nk &lt;- 10\nfolds &lt;- sample(1:k, size = nrow(Boston), replace = TRUE)\nCVerrors &lt;- matrix(NA,\n  nrow = k, ncol = 13,\n  dimnames = list(NULL, paste(1:13))\n)\nfor (j in 1:k) {\n  fit &lt;- regsubsets(crim ~ ., data = Boston[folds != j, ], nvmax = 13)\n  for (i in 1:13) {\n    pred &lt;- predict.regsubsets(fit, newdata = Boston[folds == j, ], id = i)\n    CVerrors[j, i] &lt;- mean((Boston$crim[folds == j] - pred)^2)\n  }\n}\nMSEs.CV &lt;- apply(CVerrors, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)\n\n# Plotting the Test MSEs from Validation Set and 10-fold CV approaches\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nplot(ModelsMSE,\n  type = \"b\", xlab = \"Number of Predictors in the Model\",\n  ylab = \"\", main = \"Validation Set Test MSE\", col = \"orange\"\n)\npoints(\n  x = which.min(ModelsMSE), y = min(ModelsMSE), col = \"orange\",\n  cex = 2, pch = 20\n)\nplot(MSEs.CV,\n  type = \"b\", xlab = \"Number of Predictors in the Model\",\n  ylab = \"\", main = \"10-fold CV Test MSE\", col = \"brown\"\n)\npoints(\n  x = which.min(MSEs.CV), y = min(MSEs.CV), col = \"brown\",\n  cex = 2, pch = 20\n)\n\n\n\n# Displaying the best model selected finally (Best Subset Selection)\nround(coef(regsubsets(crim ~ ., data = Boston, nvmax = 13), id = 9), 2)\n\n(Intercept)          zn       indus         nox         dis         rad \n      19.12        0.04       -0.10      -10.47       -1.00        0.54 \n    ptratio       black       lstat        medv \n      -0.27       -0.01        0.12       -0.18 \n\n\nNow, we use the lasso on the same data set using glmnet() function of the glmnet library.

The cross validation Test MSEs are calculated automatically. The least Test MSE occur at \\(M=13\\). Thus, no dimension reduction occurs. The lowest Test MSEs are around 42 with both PCR and PLS. These are higher than other methods.\n\nlibrary(pls)\n\n# Fitting the PCR and PLS models\nset.seed(3)\nfit.pcr &lt;- pcr(crim ~ ., data = Boston, scale = TRUE, validation = \"CV\")\nfit.pls &lt;- plsr(crim ~ ., data = Boston, scale = TRUE, validation = \"CV\")\n\n# Plotting the Test MSE (Cross Validation) from PCR and PLS regression\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nvalidationplot(fit.pcr, val.type = \"MSEP\", main = \"PCR\", ylab = \"MSE\")\nvalidationplot(fit.pls, val.type = \"MSEP\", main = \"PLS\", ylab = \"MSE\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\nBased on these results in (a), the model with the lowest Test MSE happens to be Best Subset Selection model with 9 predictors. But, since validation set Test MSE is highly variable, we use the Cross-Validation Test MSE. The model with lowest Cross Validation Test MSE turns out to be the Lasso model using all 13 predictors.\n\n\n(c)\nYes, the model chosen in part (b) includes all the 13 predictors, i.e. all features of the data set are used for prediction. This is in agreement with the findings from ridge regression, principal components regression and partial least squares. None of these models favor dimension reduction."
